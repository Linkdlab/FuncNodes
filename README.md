# FuncNodes - A Node-Based Data Processing Framework

FuncNodes is a powerful and flexible node-based data processing framework designed for creating complex data flow and processing pipelines. It allows users to define custom nodes, each encapsulating a specific functionality, and connect them to form a directed graph that represents the data processing logic.

## Features

- **Node-Based Architecture**: Create custom nodes with unique processing capabilities and connect them to build sophisticated data processing pipelines.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Leverage Python's asyncio for concurrent processing of data across different nodes.
- **Dynamic Node Spaces**: Organize nodes into node spaces, allowing for modular and reusable components.
- **Event-Driven**: Nodes can emit and listen for events, enabling reactive programming patterns within your data flow.
- **Serialization**: Serialize and deserialize node states and configurations, making it easy to save and load processing graphs.
- **Worker Management**: Distribute processing load across multiple workers and manage them effectively.
- **Extensible Library**: Extend the core functionality with additional libraries and integrate with existing Python packages.

## Installation

To install FuncNodes, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install funcnodes
```

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to get you started with FuncNodes:

```python
from funcnodes import Node, NodeSpace

# Define a custom node
class MyNode(Node):
    node_id = "mynode"
    node_name = "My Custom Node"

    async def func(self, input_data):
        # Process input_data and return the result
        return processed_data

# Create a node space and add nodes
space = NodeSpace()
node = MyNode()
space.add_node(node)

# Connect nodes and trigger processing
# ... (additional code to connect and use nodes)
```
